# Welcome to hqTestLite!

**hqTestLite** is an open-source, PowerShell-based testing framework. It is designed to automate the testing of complex systems (like [Enterprise Data Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_data_management) systems) that normally resist efficient test automation.

**hqTestLite** currently supports the [Markit Enterprise Data Management](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/edm.html) platform, but can easily be adapted to support testing of any platform of any kind that meets the following prerequisites:

* It can be invoked from the Windows command line.
* It can be induced to produce test output either via a text file or a query against a SQL Server database.

Other features:

* Tests are expressed as short PowerShell scripts, which live in your version control repository and travel with your code. 
* Tests can be shared and executed across an entire development team and in multiple environments.
* Test results are output as simple text files. Once a test result is *certified*, any difference against the certified result indicates a test failure.
* Test failure optionally invokes a text comparison engine ([WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/), by default) to visualize the diff as a *very* useful troubleshooting aid.
* Tests can be invoked from other scripts and test results can be piped to other processes to support automated regression testing and continuous delivery.

# Getting Started

First thing is to get hqTestLite installed. If it is already in use in your organization, some of this may already be done. Do that parts that are not.

1. Clone this repository into a shared directory that is accessible to your whole development team.
1. Copy script *config_template.ps1* to *config.ps1* and configure it with relevant environment settings.
1. Run the scripts in the [*DB*](https://github.com/HexisData/hqTestLite/tree/master/DB) directory in the order indicated, in every DB environment where you will be performing tests. If the object names don't work with your DB object naming convention, you can change them as long as you propagate the changes through the code. Note that the *Dump_Data* stored procedure will be called by most of your test result scripts, so be sure to propagate any changes there as well!
1. Copy the [*Test*](https://github.com/HexisData/hqTestLite/tree/master/Test) directory into an appropriate location in your version control system. Best guidance is that your tests should live right alongside your code, because they ARE code!
1. From the [*Install*](https://github.com/HexisData/hqTestLite/tree/master/Install) directory, run the +INSTALL shortcut, accepting all defaults.

Now you are ready to run a test!

1. Clone a code repository containing tests to your local machine and find the *Test* directory. Navigate into one of the test folders and open a test script: it should be obvious what is going to be tested. Now right-click on the test script file and select *Run with  PowerShell*. 
1. Once text execution completes, find file *Result.txt* in the test directory. Open the file and scrutinize the test result. Is it what it should be?
1. If the test result is correct, open the main **hqTestLite** repository and drag and drop your *Result.txt* file onto the *CERTIFY* shortcut you find there. The invoked PowerShell script will copy your *Result.txt* file into *Result.certified.txt* in the same location. 
1. Now make a code change to the process under test and run the test again. If the newly generated *Result.txt* file differs from the certified version in any way, an instance of WinMerge will open, displaying the files side-by-side, so you can visualize the diff and zero in on precisely what broke.
1. If the code change and new result are desirable, certify the new results file. This becomes the baseline for future tests.
1. Check any changes into your version control system so that the next developer to exercise this code can stand on your shoulders!

If you run into any issues the first time through, see the sections below.

## Potential Installation Issues

The **+INSTALL** script configures the local system and writes local configurations to the Windows Registry. So long as the user has local admin privileges, this script should self-elevate and just work. In case it does not, check the items below and then run the installation script again.

### Local Execution Policy

All **hqTestLite** tests are articulated as PowerShell scripts. The first time you run a PowerShell script on your machine, you may get an error indicating that the execution of scripts is disabled on your system. If this occurs, open a PowerShell command prompt *as administrator* and run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Click [here](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/2702/setting-the-powershell-execution-policy) for more info on setting your local execution policy.

Note also that there is also an issue around the network location from which a script is run. Scripts that are run from an internet location, as opposed to a LAN location, raise special alerts. If your network location can be expressed either way (i.e. `//domain/resources/...` vs `//domain.com/resources/...`, choose the LAN version to minimize security alerts.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

### SQL Server Module

The first time you execute a test, **hqTestLite** may attempt to download and install the *SqlServer* PowerShell module. If this occurs, you will see prompts requesting permission to run NuGet. Grant the requested permissions. 

If this process breaks and you see errors indicating that the module is not connecting to SQL Server, open a PowerShell command prompt *as administrator* and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer
```

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

### Markit EDM

By default, **hqTestLite** is expecting Markit EDM (MEDM) v17.1.132.0 to be installed in the default installation directory on your local machine. If you are running a different version of MEDM, or from a different directory, indicate the Process Agent Path when you run the **+INSTALL** script:

![MedmProcessAgentPath](/../Doc/MedmProcessAgentPath.PNG)

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## WinMerge

**hqTestLite** uses [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org) as its text comparison engine. If you don't already have it, please download and install WinMerge from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmerge)

**hqTestLite** expects WinMerge to reside in its default installation directory. If you have elected to install WinMerge in a different directory, please add the following line to your *local_config.ps1* configuration script:

```powershell
$Global:DefaultTextDiffExe = "<path to WinMerge exe>\WinMergeU.exe"
```

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## Changing Environments

Environment-specific values are managed centrally in script *env_config.ps1*. The active testing environment is selected with an edit to *local_config.ps1*:

```powershell
# Set active environment. Valid values: DEV, TMP.
$Global:ActiveEnvironment = "DEV"
```

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

# Global Variables

The hqTestLite module creates a number of global variables, whose default values are set directly in *hqTestLite.psm1*. 

A number of scenarios require these values to be overridden at the local level, for example so that one developer might run his tests in environment other than DEV.

Environment-specific variables are centrally managed in *env_config.ps1*. To select an active testing environment, set `$Global:ActiveEnvironment` in *local_config.ps1*.

To override a global variable in your local environment, simply copy the variable definition from *hqTestLite.psm1* to your *local_config.ps1* file and set it to the desired value. For example, to shift test execution from the DEV to the TEMP environment, add:
```powershell
$Global:DefaultMedmDbName = "MarkitEDM_TMP"
```
To create a new global variable, simply add it to *env_config.ps1*. If necessary, override its value locally in *local_config.ps1*.

| Global Variable | Description | Default Value |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ActiveEnvironment | Sets the environment against which tests will be executed. Leverages shared script *env_config.ps1* to set relevant global variables. | `"DEV"` |
| DefaultMedmProcessAgentPath | The local path to the MEDM Process Agent executable. This path will vary based on the MEDM version in use. Should be consistent across the team. | `"C:\Program Files\Markit Group\Markit EDM_17_1_132_0\CadisProcessAgent.exe"`|
| DefaultMedmDbServer | The SQL Server of the MEDM environment against which the test will execute. | `"DbServer"` |
| DefaultMedmDbName | The SQL Server database name of the MEDM environment against which the test will execute. | `"DbName"` |
| DefaultTextDiffExe | The local path to your text comparison engine's executable (WinMerge by default). | `"C:\Program Files (x86)\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe"` |
| DefaultTextDiffParams | An array of strings representing the text comparison engine's command-line parameters. Tokens `{CurrentResult}` and `{CertfiedResult}` will be replaced by the relevant file names. | `@("/e", "/s", "/u", "/wl", "/wr", "/dl", "Current Result", "/dr", "Certified Result", "{CurrentResult}", "{CertifiedResult}"`) |
| DefaultSuppressTextDiffPopup | When `$true`, this switch prevents the text comparison engine from being invoked in the event of a failed test. Useful for automated regression testing. | `$false` |
| DefaultSqlScriptType | The script type token to use when `-Verbose` or `-WhatIf` are activated. Useful for troubleshooting. | `"Sql Script"` |
| DefaultReportFolder | The default location where *Publish-Results* will place test results reports. | `"C:\hqTestLite\Results"` |

# Cmdlets

hqTestLite features the following cmdlets. Most are used internally, but any may be used in your test scripts or elsewhere.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## Confirm-File

Performs file validation. Pops up the diff tool on completion, and writes out test results in JUnit format. *Confirm-File* is useful in the case where you have multiple files output by the process under test. You can call *Invoke-MedmComponent* and then call *Confirm-File* multiple times (once per file output from the process). 

Internally, *Test-MedmComponent* calls *Confirm-File* to validate the test results with a certified file. 

**Syntax**

```powershell
Confirm-File `
	-FilePath <string> `
	-CertifiedFilePath <string> `
	[-SuppressTextDiffPopup] `
	[-TextDiffExe <string>] `
	[-TextDiffParams <string[]>] `

## Import-CsvTable

Converts a CSV file into a set of SQL insert statements and executes them against a database as follows:

* The table name will be the file name, excluding the CSV extension. If the table is in a non-default schema, add the schema name to the file name, like this: `myschema.MYTABLE.csv`.
* The column names will be drawn from the first row of the CSV file. Column names will be enclosed in square brackets, so odd column names are still valid.
* All values will be inserted as text, with any single quotes escaped. The system relies on implicit conversion to the table column's native type.
* The system performs no checking around nonexistent column names, invalid types, primary key collisions, etc. Any of these will produce a SQL error. *Caveat emptor.*

**Syntax**

```powershell
Import-CsvTable `
    [-DbServer <string>] `
    [-DbName <string>] `
    -CsvPath <string>

# Scripts

The hqTestLite repository contains a number of scripts that provide utility functions or leverage the module in useful ways.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## cert.ps1

This script powers the +CERTIFY shortcut in the main directory of the repository. When a user drops a file onto this shortcut, the *cert.ps1* creates a copy of the file in the same location, with ".certified" inserted at the end of the file name and before the extension.

For example, *Result.txt* would generate *Result.certified.txt*.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## GenerateTestData.ps1

This script generates a CSV of test data based on a database table schema, with an interactive user experience. The script leverages cmdlets *Read-UserEntry* and *Export-CsvTestData*.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-hqtestlite)

## runall.ps1

This script powers the +RUNALL shortcut in the main directory of the repository. When a user drops a directory onto this shortcut, all .PS1 scripts inside the directory are executed with recursion.
